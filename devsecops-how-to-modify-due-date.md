# Postponing the due date of an incident issue
{: #due-date-postpone}

If you want to postpone the due date of an incident issue, you can ask for a review from a security focal. Depending on the review, the due date can be postponed by modifying the `Due date` field in the GRIT incident issues meta fields. Be sure to reference the security-focal review in the issue, such as providing a link to it in a comment.
